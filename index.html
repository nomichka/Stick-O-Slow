<!--
	To add a basic new problem:
		Add a div with an id of that problem (e.g. <div id="sorting stars">)
			Inside the div, add a p with a class of the problem + "problem"(e.g. < p class="sorting stars problem">)
			Inside the div, add a form/input with the same class (e.g. <form><input class="sorting stars problem" type="number" name="answer"></form>
			Inside the div, add a p with a class of the problem + "after" (e.g. <p class="sorting stars after">)
				This p will be empty until you add to it with javascript 
		Go to myscripts.js and read the documentation there on how to process input
