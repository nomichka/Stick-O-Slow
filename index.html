<!--
	To add a basic new problem:
		Add a div with an id of that problem (e.g. <div id="sorting stars">)
			Inside the div, add a p with a class of the problem + "problem"(e.g. < p class="sorting stars problem">)
			Inside the div, add a form/input with the same class (e.g. <form><input class="sorting stars problem" type="number" name="answer"></form>
			Inside the div, add a p with a class of the problem + "after" (e.g. <p class="sorting stars after">)
				This p will be empty until you add to it with javascript 
		Go to myscripts.js and read the documentation there on how to process input

        Welcome to the Game of Sticks!
      </p>
      <p class="welcome2">
        In this game, you are an All-Powerful Being that has decided to create a More Efficient Universe. To accomplish this task, you'll have to solve problems and stuff using the Power of Programming.</p>
      <p class="welcome3">
        It'll be difficult at times, but I promise to keep my faith in you and help in any way I can. As you play this game, my hope is that you learn advanced programming concepts - so that you can implement them to advance in the game, and so that you can implement them to advance in life.

        Let's begin?

        You look around your universe.

        Yay!
      </p>
      <p class="sorting-stars-numbers">
        To make the stars, simply enter 1000 distinct, comma-and-space-separated numbers into the box below (e.g. 9482548, 7, 42, ... etc.). Each number will represent the volume of a single star.
      </p>
      <p class="sorting-stars-numbers">
        Note: I'd recommend creating the numbers through a program, unless you prefer to create <em>1000</em> distinct numbers by hand.

        Sort the stars into increasing order by volume. The input is below. Each number represents the volume of a star, in km cubed. <br><br>
